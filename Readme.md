# About plugin

This plugin generates thumbnails instead of simple link icons on object grids. Thumbnails are clickable and after clicking, a modal with a bigger version is shown.

## Plugin outcome

The thumbnail is visible in the grid:

<img src=".docs/images/grid.png" alt="plugin-settings" width="700"/>

And after clicking on it the modal is visible:

<img src=".docs/images/modal.png" alt="plugin-settings" width="700"/>

You can open the full image by clicking the blue arrow in the modal.

## Configuring plugin

To manage a plugin, you must first add it to your plugins. Click the "+" icon to add the plugin to your library and click the "Manage" button. It will open the plugin settings.

# Development

## Quick start

1. `yarn` - to install dependencies
2. `yarn start` - to start development mode - rebuild on file modifications
3. update your `plugin-manifest.json` file to contain the production URL and other plugin information
4. `yarn build` - to build plugins

## Dev environment

Dev environment is configured to use:

* `prettier` - best used with automatic format on save in IDE
* `eslint` - it is built into both `start` and `build` commands

## Output

The plugins are built into a single `dist/index.js` file. The manifest is copied to `dist/plugin-manifest.json` file.
